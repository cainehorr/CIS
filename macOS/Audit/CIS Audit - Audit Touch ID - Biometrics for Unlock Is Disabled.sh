#   BENCHMARK NAME:
#   CIS Audit - Audit Touch ID - Biometrics for Unlock Is Disabled
#
#   PROFILE APPLICABILITY: 
#   Level 1
#
#   DESCRIPTION: 
#   Apple has integrated Touch ID with macOS and allows fingerprint use for many
#   common operations. All use of Touch ID requires the presence of a password and the
#   use of that password after every reboot, or when more than 48 hours has elapsed since
#   the device was last unlocked. Touch ID is not a password replacement. The use of
#   Touch ID can, however, make the use of passwords more secure for authorized users
#   with physical access to a Mac. Normal day-to-day work operations can eliminate the
#   use of console password entry unless a reboot is required other than on Monday
#   morning. The infrequency of password screen unlock can enable a more complicated
#   pass phrase that is seldom used. When Touch ID is used it remediates the risk of
#   shoulder surfing (including video surveillance) to capture console credentials. There
#   have been many reported shoulder surfing password captures on iOS devices. Reports
#   have not been widespread on Macs, but shoulder surfing password capture is simpler
#   than the other methods of breaking in to an encrypted Mac.
#   
#   When a SmartCard or YubiKey is provisioned by an organization and is available for
#   Console authentication, that is a much more secure option than the use of Touch ID and
#   is preferred.
#
#   RATIONALE: 
#   Touch ID allows for an account-enrolled fingerprint to access a key that uses a
#   previously provided password.
#
#   IMPACT: 
#   Touch ID is more convenient for use with aggressive screen lock controls.
#
#   AUDIT: 
#   Verify Touch ID settings for Unlock.
