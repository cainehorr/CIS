#   BENCHMARK NAME:
#   CIS Audit - Ensure AirDrop Is Disabled When Not Actively Transferring Files - AirDrop is Disabled
#
#   PROFILE APPLICABILITY: 
#   Level 1
#
#   DESCRIPTION: 
#   AirDrop is Apple's built-in, on-demand, ad hoc file exchange system that is compatible
#   with both macOS and iOS. It uses Bluetooth LE for discovery that limits connectivity to
#   Mac or iOS users that are in close proximity. Depending on the setting, it allows
#   everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are near each other.
#
#   In many ways, this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done
#   over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file
#   sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows
#   for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts
#   can interact with you.
#   
#   While there are positives to AirDrop, there are privacy concerns that could expose
#   personal information. For that reason, AirDrop should be disabled, and should only be
#   enabled when needed and disabled afterwards. The recommendation against enabling
#   the sharing is not based on any known lack of security in the protocol, but for specific
#   user operational concerns.
#
#   * If AirDrop is enabled, the Mac is advertising that a Mac is addressable on the
#   local network and open to either unwanted AirDrop upload requests or for a
#   negotiation on whether the remote user is in the user's contacts list. Neither
#   process is desirable.
#  
#   * In most known use cases, AirDrop use qualifies as ad hoc networking when it
#   involves Apple device users deciding to exchange a file using the service.
#   AirDrop can thus be enabled on the fly for that exchange.
#   For organizations concerned about any use of AirDrop because of Digital Loss
#   Prevention (DLP) monitoring on other protocols, JAMF has an article on reviewing
#   AirDrop logs.
#
#   Detecting outbound AirDrop transfers and logging them
#   https://www.jamf.com/blog/stop-potential-airdrop-transfer-data-leaks-with-jamf-protect/
#
#   RATIONALE: 
#   AirDrop can allow malicious files to be downloaded from unknown sources. Contacts Only limits 
#   may expose personal information to devices in the same area.
#
#   IMPACT: 
#   Disabling AirDrop can limit the ability to move files quickly over the network without using 
#   file shares.
#   
#   AUDIT: 
#   Verify that AirDrop is disabled.
