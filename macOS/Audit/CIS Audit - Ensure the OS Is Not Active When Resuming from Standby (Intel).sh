#   BENCHMARK NAME:
#   CIS Audit - Ensure the OS Is Not Active When Resuming from Standby (Intel)
#
#   PROFILE APPLICABILITY: 
#   Level 2
#
#   DESCRIPTION: 
#   In order to use a computer with Full Disk Encryption (FDE), macOS must keep
#   encryption keys in memory to allow the use of the disk that has been FileVault
#   protected. The storage volume has been unlocked and acts as if it were not encrypted.
#   When the system is not in use, the volume is protected through encryption. When the
#   system is sleeping and available to quickly resume, the encryption keys remain in
#   memory.
#   
#   https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/08/20/laptop-sleep-security/
#   
#   Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period.
#   The default value for "standbydelay" is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely
#   appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less
#   physically secure areas with confidential data, this value might be adjusted. The
#   desktop would have to retain power, however, so that the running OS or physical RAM
#   could be attacked.
#   
#   MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less.
#   This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured
#   areas while going to a conference room, auditorium, or other internal location without
#   having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night, the laptop will auto-
#   hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging
#   back into the system when it resumes.
#   
#   MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM.
#   This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system.
#   
#   Macs running Apple silicon chips, rather than Intel chips, do not require the same
#   configuration as Intel-based Macs.
#
#   RATIONALE: 
#   To mitigate the risk of data loss, the system should power down and lock the encrypted
#   drive after a specified time. Laptops should hibernate 15 minutes or less after sleeping.
#
#   IMPACT: 
#   The laptop will take additional time to resume normal operation if only sleeping rather
#   than hibernating.
#   
#   Setting hibernatemode to 25 will disable the "always-on" feature of the Apple Silicon
#   Macs.
#
#   AUDIT: 
#   Verify the hibernation settings.
