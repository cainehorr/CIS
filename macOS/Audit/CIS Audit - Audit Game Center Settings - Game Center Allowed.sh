#   BENCHMARK NAME:
#   CIS Audit - Audit Game Center Settings - Game Center Allowed
#
#   PROFILE APPLICABILITY: 
#   Level 1
#
#   DESCRIPTION: 
#   With macOS 10.13, Apple has introduced a separate section for Game Center in
#   System Settings. It is possible to log in with the Apple Account and use the iCloud-
#   based Game Center services.
#   
#   Game Center is a feature from Apple that allows users to engage in game-related
#   activities with friends when playing multiplayer games online on the Game Center social
#   network. User profile data such as nickname, contact discovery, and also nearby
#   players may be shared through iCloud.
#   
#   Apple collects information here, such as the games users play and when they play
#   them, all scores and achievements, and the challenges users send and receive. This
#   information is used to track users' high scores, achievements, and challenges and to
#   improve Game Center.
#   
#   The automatic sign in to Game Center with AppleID should be disabled if not aligned
#   with organizational rules
#   
#   Personal profile visibility, Finding by Friends, requests from Contacts, Nearby Player
#   detection and Connecting with Friends are all visibility options that should be risk
#   accepted through an organizational policy before use.
#   
#   Users should not sign in to Game Center on organizational managed devices if not
#   covered under acceptable use. For personal devices Gam
#
#   RATIONALE: 
#   Ensure Game Center service is used consistently with organizational requirements.
#
#   IMPACT: 
#   Game Center is designed as a social network to use Apple's gaming service and
#   includes capabilities to discover players in the service as through local network
#   discovery. If the Apple feature is not needed it should not be on, and should not be
#   signed in.
#
#   AUDIT: 
#   Verify the status of iCloud Game Center service.
