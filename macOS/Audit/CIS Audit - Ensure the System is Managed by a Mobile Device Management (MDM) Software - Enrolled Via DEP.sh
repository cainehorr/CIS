#   BENCHMARK NAME:
#   CIS Audit - Ensure the System is Managed by a Mobile Device Management (MDM) Software - Enrolled Via DEP
#
#   PROFILE APPLICABILITY: 
#   Level 1
#
#   DESCRIPTION: 
#   Apple provides the capability to manage macOS, iOS, and iPadOS using Mobile Device
#   Management (MDM). Profiles are used to configure devices to enforce security controls
#   as well as to configure the devices for authorized access. Many security controls
#   available on Apple devices are only available through the use of profile settings using
#   MDM. This capability is also misused by attackers who have added rogue profiles to the
#   list of unwanted software and fake software updates to induce users to approve the
#   installation of malicious content. Organizations should have Mobile Device Management
#   software in place to harden organizationally managed devices and take advantage of
#   additional Apple controls, as well as to make the devices more resistant to attackers
#   enticing users to install unwanted content from rogue MDMs.
#
#   RATIONALE: 
#   Mobile Device Management is the preferred Apple method to manage Apple devices.
#   Some capability in this technology is a requirement for the enforcement of some
#   controls. Users with managed devices should be trained and familiar with authorized
#   content provided through the organization's MDM.
#
#   IMPACT: 
#   An MDM is yet another additional tool that requires technically adept personnel to
#   manage correctly. In theory, proper use of an MDM can make services provisioning
#   simpler with configuration profiles to reach authorized services.
#
#   AUDIT: 
#   Verify the system is enrolled in a Mobile Device Management software.
